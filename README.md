# Coding Interview Backend
## Run the project

### Prerequisites
* JDK 17
* Docker (Desktop)
* IntelliJ IDEA (or other JAVA IDE)

To run the project, we need a PostgreSQL database, so we should run the docker-compose file

## The Challenge
To get to know your coding style a little better, we have created a coding interview challenge. 
Write your code in the quality you think is suited best for a big project and decide by yourself if you want to write tests for features.

You don't have to implement every feature to the end but far enough to get an idea of what you wanted to archive. (If you have to implement things multiple times, it is okay to implement it 2-3 times for example)

### Addresses
Add addresses to your users
* you should be able to add, remove or change addresses of a users
* it should be possible to get all addresses without users
* if a user is deleted, all addresses of this user should be deleted as well
* one user can have multiple addresses

### Validation
* all input fields should be validated

### Error Handling
* all errors should be handled properly
* all rest endpoints should return a proper error message and code
